# Quantum-Resistance Meets White-Box Cryptography: How to Implement Hash-Based Signatures against White-Box Attackers?

This project provides implementations of two schemes from our paper [Quantum-Resistance Meets White-Box Cryptography: How to Implement Hash-Based Signatures against White-Box Attackers?](https://ia.cr/2021/968):

1. **White-Box Stateful Hash-Based Signatures**: The quantum-resistant signature scheme designed to resist white-box attacks.
2. **White-Box Secure One-Time Passwords (OTP)**: A time-based OTP solution protected against white-box attackers.
